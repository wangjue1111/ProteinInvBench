This repository is an open-source project for benchmarking structure-based protein design methods, which provides a variety of collated datasets, reprouduced methods, novel evaluation metrics, and fine-tuned models that are all integrated into one unified framework. It also contains the implementation code for the paper:

## Introduction

[ProteinInvBench](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bqXduvuW5E) is the first comprehensive benchmark for protein design. The main contributions of our paper could be listed as four points below:

* **Tasks:** We extend recent impressive models from single-chain protein design to the scenarios of multi-chain and de-novoprotein design.
* **Models:** We integrate recent impressive models into a unified framework for efficiently reproducing and extending them to custom tasks.
* **Metrics:** We incorporate new metrics such as confidence, sc-TM, and diversity for protein design, and integrate metrics including recovery, robustness, and efficiency to formulate a comprehensive evaluation system.
* **Benchmark:** We establish the first comprehensive benchmark of protein design, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different methods.

## Overview

<details open>
<summary>Major Features</summary>

- **Unified Code Framework**
  ProteinInvBench integrates the protein design system pipeline into a unified framework. From data preprocessing to model training, evaluating and result recording, all the methods collected in this paper could be conducted in the same way, which simplifies further analysis to the problem. In detail, ProteinInvBench decomposes computational protein design algorithms into `methods` (training and prediction), `models` (network architectures), and `modules. `Users can develop their own algorithms with flexible training strategies and networks for different protein design tasks.
- **Comprehensive Model Implementation**
  ProteinInvBench collects a wide range of recent impressive models together with the datasets and reproduces all the methods in each of the datasets with restricted manners.
- **Standard Benchmarks**
  ProteinInvBench supports standard benchmarks of computational protein design algorithms with various evaluation metrics, including novel ones such as confidence, diversity, and sc-TM. The wide range of evaluataion metrics helps to have a more comprehensive understanding of different protein design algorithms.

## News and Updates

[2023-06-16] `ProteinInvBench` v0.1.0 is released.

## Installation

This project has provided an environment setting file of conda, users can easily reproduce the environment by the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/A4Bio/OpenCPD.git
cd opencpd
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate opencpd
python setup.py develop
```

## Getting Started

**Obtaining Dataset**

The processed datasets could be found in the [releases](https://github.com/A4Bio/ProteinInvBench/releases/tag/dataset_release). 

*To note that, due to the large file size, ProteinMPNN dataset was uploaded in a separate file named mpnn.tar.gz, others could be found in data.tar.gz*

**Model Training**

```shell
python main.py --method {method} 
```
